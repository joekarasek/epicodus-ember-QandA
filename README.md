# Ember Q and A

## _**By Joseph Karasek**_

## Description

_This app is designed to function as a question and answer board. Users can create questions, edit and update questions, and delete questions. Users can also create and view multiple answers for each question (a one to many database relationship)._

_This code was put together for the week 3 code review for the Level 2 Javascript Epicodus course. The following objectives outline the requirements to pass this code review._

* Create a question and answer message board where a user submits a question and other users can respond with answers.
* Questions should have the content of the question itself, an author and additional notes.
* Answers should have the content of the answer and the author.
* Include a header and/or navbar that appears on all pages containing the name of your site and a link to the home page.
* List all questions on the homepage, with only the question and the name of the author showing.
* Users should be able to click on a question to view additional information.
* Allow users to add and edit questions.
* Allow users to add answers to a question. Answers should be added and viewed on the same page as the question they respond to.
